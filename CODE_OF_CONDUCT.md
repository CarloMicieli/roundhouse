# Code of Conduct

We value a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community. All contributors are expected to follow this Code of Conduct.

- Be respectful and considerate in all communications.
- Assume good faith: people contribute in different ways and at different paces.
- Avoid discriminatory, harassing, or abusive language or behavior.
- When giving feedback, be constructive and focus on the code or design, not the person.
- Respect others' time and effort; be patient during reviews.

Unacceptable behavior includes but is not limited to:

- Violence, threats, or the promotion of violence.
- Insults, name-calling, or personal attacks.
- Harassment based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other protected characteristics.

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. Reports will be handled with discretion.

Consequences: Maintainers reserve the right to remove or block contributors who violate this Code of Conduct. For serious or repeated violations, contributors may be banned from participating in the project.
